# Segy
segy file Read-Write Library. 
Extract the core part from SU. However, the library only supports float-type segy data reading and writing. It can be used for personal scientific research, however production with caution.

This library is for my personal scientific research. There are some unknowns: bugs, but they don't affect my use.
